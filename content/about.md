### Data Scientist at HSBC

Working in a super cool Data Science and Engineering lab in HSBCâ€™s Toronto office. Lead a pod of interns to green-field a simple NLP application, and even done some pretty basic linear regressions on my own. I've gotten familiar with Spark, GCP, and Hadoop.

### Exchange Student

Before that was a Rotary Youth Exchange student in the Luxembourg region of Belgium where I tried to learn French but mostly learned to love chocolate, waffles, and beer.

### East Coaster

Grew up on a small farm in beautiful Billtown, Nova Scotia where my interest in how everything works was cultivated among a ton of old farm machines and various contraptions that I built myself.
