Talk by Andrew Skeldon

== Incentives Landscape in Canada

Overview, there are a few buckets:

- **Tax credits**, typically no defined budget, if you meet criteria you apply and get it.
- **Defined grants and discretionary**, government picks-and-chooses based on many rules.
- **Negotiated**, very large investment, company may go directly to government and present business case.

There are roughly 3,000 programs in Canada.
They have general themes though:

- **R&D Projects**, for product and process from basic research to shop floor
- **Capital Investments**
- **Employment**, creation, conversion, and training.
- **Location**
- **Environment**
- **New Markets**

Focus and opportunities, of late, Federal Side:

- Big push on *Clean Tech*, energy/environment.
- Innovation and AI
- Critical minerals
- Agri-food
- Indigenous support

Ontario Provincial:

- Similar
- Automotive and electric vehicles

Shift away from direct grants toward loans.

## Key Considerations

- Plan ahead, application for non-tax incentives must be made **before** the investment begins.
- Budget, stacking possible, typically <75% of the project cost.
- Partnerships, number of plans want multiple entities

## Tips

- Understand the program
- Demonstrate the plan
- Direct and succinct
- Show capabilities to execute
- Avoid fluff
- Justify funding need

## SR&ED

Tax credit. What's new: CRA review has brought up the "5 Questions", really 2: How did you go about the project? Why did you go with this project? They want to see a systematic approach and some advancement in knowledge.

## Clean Economy ITCs

There are 6 credits.
Refundable tax rate is different for each program.
Some are subject to labor requirements.
None of this applies to anything I'm doing, but let's talk about:

- Clean Technology Investment Taxi Credit, these ITCs are very much focused on capital assets.
- Mostly solar panels, heat pumps, etc.
- Includes industrial zero-emission vehicles, charging stations, and more.

## Discretionary Program Examples

Defined criteria, priorities.

- May be mentorship, senior consulting.
