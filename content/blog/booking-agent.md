# Call from Annie 

There's not just one way to do it.

One is through application processes, some venues have something on their website, usually an email to a booking agent, sometimes an email to manager of bar.

Sometimes just cold email, or hopping onto other artists bills, especially out of town things, "my pull was really small", connect to see if there were other musicians I could piggybacking off of.

You can find applications for 'showcase', you send in 'assets', past music, live video of you recording, sometimes references/contacts. Select availability.

Some people just show up in dms/email to join into tours they're doing when they come into town.

Become friends with venue bookers/festival bookers.

But now, lot of word-of-mouth. Initially, lots of networking, just showing up, being a face around.
