I found this while googling for different types of radar jamming acronyms at the bottom of a wikipedia article.

# Summary

Bats use echolocation to pinpoint airborne insects in darkness. Some bugs do other things. Tiger Moths click ultrasonically in response to attacking bats. 3 possible reasons: Startle, warning, and jamming. Clicking moths are juicy, so bad warning. Bats aren't startled long. Past studies used low duty cycle moths, and didn't find jamming. This uses high duty cycle moths. 16 moths are prepared, 4 that click, 4 that don't, and 8 different ones that don't. Bats get 1 min or 5 swoops. 

After many trials, all but one bat seemed to like to eat these moths, they didn't need to learn to be bad at catching them with prior experience, and bats didn't get good at catching them. The bats don't mind the clicks, and will re-attack within a second. The bats moved through phases of their attacks weird with the sounds, and didn't get better with it as you would expect if they were startled. 

# Thoughts 

Shockingly small sample size, very interesting, I'd like to see just playing the clicks on identical moths to see if that confused the bats.
